          <strong> 2.4 Consent for Children Under 16</strong>
          <br />
          By using our service, you represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years
          of age. No one under the age of 16 may use the Service, except as set forth as
          follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Polus is not directed to children, and we expect that any use by children will
          only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents,
          guardians and/or authorized school officials. If you are under the age of 16 you
          must receive consent from a parent, guardian and/or an authorized school
          official to use the Service. Polus relies on parents and guardians to ensure
          that minors only use Polus if they can understand their rights and
          responsibilities as laid out in these Terms of Service and in our Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are an authorized school official in the United States or in the EU and
          want your students, who are under the age of 16, to create Polus accounts, you
          are responsible for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection
          Act ("COPPA") and, to the extent applicable, the Family Educational Rights and
          Privacy Act ("FERPA"), or the GDPR policy, respectively. This means that you
          must notify the students' parents/guardians of the personally identifiable
          information that Polus will collect, and that you will obtain parental/guardian
          consent before your students establish accounts or use Polus. When obtaining
          such consent, you must provide their parents or guardians with a copy of our
          Privacy Policy and keep all consents on file and provide them to us upon
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission's
          website. If you are located outside of the United States, we will rely on you to
          obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or guardian of any
          student covered by similar laws, and, as a condition to your and your students'
          use of Polus, you agree that you will be responsible for complying with such
          laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with
          personal information, without the consent of a parent, guardian and/or an
          authorized school official, we will delete the child’s account and information.
          If you are aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided Polus with
          personal information without the consent of a parent, guardian and/or an
          authorized school official, please contact Polus support.
